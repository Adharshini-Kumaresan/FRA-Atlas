Suklampatti,Pachamalai Reserved Forest,"The reserved forest maintains 40–70% canopy cover, stabilizing the soil and preventing erosion in the hilly terrain. It regulates local climate by retaining moisture and improving fertility for nearby agricultural fields.","Seasonal Stream (0.8 km), Pond (1.9 km)","The stream helps recharge shallow wells and small tanks during the rainy season. The pond acts as a critical source of irrigation and cattle water supply in summer.",Eastern Ghats Hotspot,"Supports native trees like Terminalia and Albizia, maintaining ecological balance. Small mammals, reptiles, and birds thrive, forming an interdependent ecosystem with the forest."
Nadupatti,Open Forest Patch,"Tree cover is scattered with <40% canopy density, supporting mixed agriculture and grazing. The patch provides firewood and grazing land, crucial for village households.",Village Tank (0.6 km),"The tank stores seasonal rainwater, ensuring irrigation for paddy and millet fields. It also supports livestock, becoming essential during dry months.",Eastern Ghats Edge,"Common bird species like parakeets and mynas are frequently seen around the village. Medicinal shrubs and small reptiles sustain a modest biodiversity balance."
Kovilpatti (Hill),Hill-Slope Forest (Pachamalai),"The forest on the slopes prevents landslides by anchoring soil with deep-rooted trees. It offers timber, honey, and medicinal herbs for the local population.","Hill Spring (1.2 km), Stream (0.9 km)","Hill springs provide perennial drinking water for people and cattle. Seasonal streams aid in terrace farming, helping retain soil moisture.",Eastern Ghats Hotspot,"Region is known for orchids and wildflowers, enriching ecological diversity. Species like the slender loris and butterflies find safe habitats in this forested zone."
Murungaiyur,Pachamalai Reserved Forest,"Moderately dense forest stabilizes rainfall patterns and groundwater recharge. Sustains multiple layers of vegetation that shelter wildlife and prevent desertification.","Uppar Reservoir (3.2 km), Streams (1.1 km)","Reservoir supports extensive irrigation for farmlands and reduces drought stress. Small streams act as natural drainage systems, recharging aquifers.",Eastern Ghats Hotspot,"Rich in medicinal plants like Amla and Neem, used by tribal healers. Mammals such as deer and hares roam in forest corridors."
Vannadu,Open Forest Patches,"Tree cover is sparse, mostly used for grazing and fuelwood. Vulnerable to erosion due to poor canopy density.",Pond (0.5 km),"Pond sustains livestock and is critical in dry spells. Acts as a temporary rain-fed source for marginal agriculture.",Eastern Ghats Fringe,"Birds of prey like eagles and owls hunt in open fields. Reptiles such as snakes and lizards are frequently spotted."
Thenpallipatti,Scrub Forest with Thorny Vegetation,"Sparse acacia and thorny bushes. Limited grazing potential. Soil erosion common during monsoon.",Seasonal Pond (1.2 km),"Rain-fed, dries by early summer. Used for cattle and small-scale farming.",Dry Savannah Fringe,"Species like Indian crested porcupines, monitor lizards. Birds like Indian robins and bee-eaters commonly observed."
Kallampatti,Degraded Dry Deciduous Patch,"Canopy density <30%, frequent fuelwood extraction. Limited undergrowth due to grazing pressure.",Check Dam (2.5 km),"Captures monsoon runoff for groundwater recharge. Supports second-season crops like pulses and millets.",Eastern Ghats Transition,"Sparse populations of hares and field mice. Native shrubs like Ziziphus provide limited foraging."
Irungalur Tribal Settlements,Reserve Forest Edge,"Moderately dense canopy (50-60%) with bamboo clusters. Communities depend on non-timber forest products.",Mountain Stream (0.3 km),"Perennial flow from hill springs. Used for drinking, irrigation, and traditional fishing.",Eastern Ghats Core,"Hosts endangered medicinal plants and orchids. Mammals like Indian pangolins and slender lorises inhabit deeper forests."
Thenpuranadu,Mixed Deciduous Forest,"Robust canopy (70%) with teak and sandalwood trees. Supports regulated timber harvesting and honey collection.",Koraiyar Waterfall (4 km),"Feeds irrigation channels for paddy and banana plantations. Tourism includes safety rails and bathing points.",Biodiversity Hotspot,"Endangered birds like Malabar pied hornbills. Reptiles including king cobras and Indian rock pythons."
Keelapatti,Valley Forest,"Dense vegetation due to moisture retention in valleys. Supports sustainable herb and fruit extraction.",Perennial Stream (1 km),"Used for drip irrigation in vegetable farms. Recharges open wells in village.",Eastern Ghats Microhabitat,"Butterflies and pollinators thrive. Small carnivores like jungle cats patrol forest edges."
Melapatti,Hilltop Forest,"Wind-resistant stunted trees with high root density. Acts as a windbreak for lower settlements.",Spring-Fed Tank (2 km),"Gravity-fed irrigation for terrace farms growing turmeric and ginger. Maintains water quality via forest filtration.",Avian Corridor,"Migratory birds like warblers and flycatchers. Endemic lizards and geckos adapt to rocky surfaces."
Moolakadu Tribal Hamlets,Sacred Grove,"Old-growth trees with cultural significance. Protects biodiversity. Medicinal plant collection regulated by tribal traditions.",Forest Pond (0.8 km),"Maintained by communities for drinking and rituals. Hosts endemic amphibians and aquatic insects.",Cultural Landscape,"Tribal knowledge preserves native seed varieties and herbal uses. Insects and birds support forest pollination."
Aathinadu,Eastern Slope Forest,"High canopy cover (60-70%) with ironwood and mahogany trees. Prevents soil erosion on steep slopes.",River Tributary (1.5 km),"Provides year-round water for drinking and irrigation. Supports fishing and sand mining under community rules.",Eastern Ghats Endemic Zone,"Endangered trees like Pterocarpus santalinus. Mammals such as Indian giant squirrels and leopards."
Sirumugai Tribal Hamlets,Bamboo-Dominated Forest,"Rapid growth cycles support tribal craftsmanship and housing. Vulnerable to invasive species like lantana.",Hill Stream (0.6 km),"Traditional check dams store water. Critical for dry-season agriculture.",Transition Ecology,"Bamboo flowering attracts rodents and predators. Birds like emerald doves and hill mynas are common."
Kaliyur,Rocky Scrub Forest,"Low canopy density due to rocky substrate, limiting tree growth. Goat grazing common, causing soil compaction.",Rainwater Harvesting Tank (1.8 km),"Stores monsoon water for summer use. Supports maize and vegetable cultivation.",Adaptive Species Niche,"Rock-dwelling species like civets and hedgehogs. Drought-resistant plants like aloe vera and agave."
Pudur Hill Settlement,Montane Grassland,"Grass species dominate due to high altitude and wind exposure. Used for grazing sheep and cattle.",Cloud-Fed Spring (2.2 km),"Intermittent flow influenced by cloud condensation. Water channeled to small farms.",Highland Ecology,"Grassland birds like pipits and larks nest here. Insects and small mammals form the food chain base."
